I believe that some of the things are hard to convey through a computer screen and resume. So I thought I could post testimonials of my ex teammates and colleagues. However, those can be forged too and I was too shy to ask. But I wanted to convey that I am a passionate, computer science loving human that loves to debug and figure out where exactly the problem is. If I could have a forte, it would be solving problems, debugging. From the first class of CS 180 (Data Structures and Algorithms) to CS 283 (current Operating Systems) the joy of finding bugs and solving them is second to none.
